# Clean.Air

> :warning: This is partially LLM-written and subject to future human polish

`Clean.Air` contains the row-oriented proof-system layer that sits on top of the core circuit DSL. It is the home for AIR-like objects: components, trace tables, channel balance, ensembles, and formal end-to-end statements.

The first supported AIR style is **flat AIR**. In a flat AIR, one circuit is checked independently on each row of a table. The circuit does not directly refer to adjacent rows. All communication between rows and between components is expressed through channel interactions. This matches the modern layout where lookups, VM state transitions, and public API links are modeled by balanced channels rather than by next-row constraints.

In this terminology, a `Flat.Component` is a one-row AIR component: it packages the circuit whose constraints are applied to every row. A `Flat.Table` is the concrete trace table and prover data for such a component. A `Flat.Tables` value is a lightweight bundle of multiple concrete tables that share the same prover data object.

## Organization

`Circuit.lean` contains shared helpers for using `GeneralFormalCircuit`s as AIR components.

`FlatComponent.lean` defines the flat AIR component layer:

- `Flat.Component`: the static one-row component, backed by a `GeneralFormalCircuit`.
- `Flat.Table`: concrete array of rows for one component, together with the prover data used to evaluate constraints and channel interactions.
- `Flat.TableContext`: a bundle of committed component tables sharing one prover data object.

It also proves the basic row-level transport lemmas: instantiated component operations agree with row operations, component soundness lifts to table soundness, and table interactions can be collected per channel.

`Balance.lean` contains the channel multiset theory. It defines `BalancedInteractions`, proves permutation and counting lemmas, and provides the channel-level implication principles used by higher-level soundness proofs. It also defines `RawChannel.Consistent` and `RawChannel.Normal`; typed channels are normal by construction, and normal channels are consistent, so both properties are satisfied in practice. A highlight in `Balance.lean` is the "guarantees-to-requirements-reversal" theorem which provides the basis for soundness of VM channels.

`FlatEnsemble.lean` defines flat AIR ensembles, `Flat.Ensemble` and their witnesses, `Flat.EnsembleWitness`. An ensemble has components, channels, and an append-only verifier program. The verifier contributes public interactions directly; its operation type cannot create witnesses, constraints, lookups, or a synthetic table. Its `Statement` is the raw proof-system relation: there exists a witness whose table constraints hold and whose table and verifier interactions are balanced. The ensemble file also defines soundness and completeness and the `FormalEnsemble` structure which bundles an ensemble with its `Spec`, `Assumptions` and the soundness proof (completeness is TODO).

**Ensemble-level soundness** is more than a simple lifting of per-circuit soundness: it requires that channel guarantees, which were _assumed_ as part of local circuit proofs, are shown to hold unconditionally from global channel balance and constraints.

The library currently provides two distinct arguments to establish soundness, covering two prominent ways of using channels:

`OrderedChannels.lean` contains a staged channel construction for ordinary lookup-like channels. The defining property is a strict hierarchy on the list of component tables: any table that pushes to a channel must come before every table that pulls from it. From little more than this property, we prove ensemble-level soundness, as encapsulated in the `SoundEnsemble` structure. On the way, we introduce a relaxed notion of channel balance called `PartialBalancedChannels` that allows the balanced interaction list to contain additional interactions from tables added later. This makes it suitable for an inductive argument or gradual addition of tables to an existing sound ensemble.

`Vm.lean` contains a construction aimed at "VM-like" components that perform one transition per row. Since VM components both pull from and push to one distinguished state channel, they cannot follow the theory of ordered lookup-channel soundness. Instead, we prove a dedicated soundness theorem that applies to a set of VM components added to an existing hierarchical ensemble; a typical modern zkVMs layout.

`WitnessGeneration.lean` constructs ensemble witnesses from public input and a separately typed
runtime prover input. Demand-driven components allocate rows from channel messages. Preallocated
components initialize their prover-owned cells from constants or strided positions in the prover
input, while the generic builder supplies any verifier-fixed prefix. Preallocated channel handlers
identify an existing component interaction and a generated multiplicity column; messages and row
indices are derived from completed rows rather than duplicated in generation metadata.

The prover input is only an input to honest witness construction. Semantic `ProverData` is always
derived from the final committed component inputs. Export currently permits `dataGet` only from
stable cells of preallocated components and rejects reads from demand-generated or mutable cells.
This makes the initial data snapshot used by witness generation agree with the final derived data
at every readable location.

## Relation To Clean/Table

`Clean/Table` is the older table infrastructure. Its `InductiveTable` interface models classic AIRs where a row transition may directly relate adjacent rows, by putting the output of one VM step in the same relative position as the input of the next step. `Clean.Air.Flat` instead models the modern one-row style: each component checks a single row in isolation, and all cross-row or cross-component structure is mediated by channels. The two layers are currently independent, but `Clean.Air` is intended to become the common home for AIR-style infrastructure, including future support for the older inductive table style now living under `Clean/Table`.
