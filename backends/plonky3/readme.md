# Clean Plonky3 backend

This crate proves channel-based Clean AIR ensembles with Plonky3.

1. Lean lowers a `Clean.Air.Flat.Ensemble` into a typed extraction program.
2. The Rust renderer emits direct row witness functions, constraint expressions, and channel
   interactions. It does not emit generic Plonky3 plumbing.
   Fixed columns and preallocated committed inputs use the same index-aware Witness IR. Generated
   code contains the fixed row program and height, rather than a materialized fixed trace.
3. `src/witness_generation.rs` runs the generated channel worklist and constructs all component
   traces without invoking Lean. Lean's witness configuration supplies semantic padding rows; the
   worklist executes them and balances any interactions they create until every trace has a
   power-of-two height.
4. `src/generated_air.rs` supplies the shared Plonky3 `Air` implementation and registers generated
   channel lookups.
5. `src/ensemble_prover.rs` proves or verifies an opaque generated statement containing every
   component AIR exactly once in canonical order. Verifier-only interactions are derived from
   public inputs and enter the global channel argument directly, without a synthetic verifier AIR
   or trace.

Statement construction binds component trace heights, exact fixed heights, and the complete
component inventory. It also checks the Clean channel-soundness side condition
`verifier interactions + Σ(trace height × interactions per row) < field order` before proving or
verification. Individual component AIRs cannot be assembled through the public API.

The Fibonacci example is documented in
[`Clean/Examples/FibonacciVm/README.md`](../../Clean/Examples/FibonacciVm/README.md). The generated
artifacts live in `tests/generated/` and are included by their corresponding Rust tests.

Regenerate the artifact from the repository root:

```bash
lake exe export_fibonacci_ensemble_rust \
  | rustfmt --edition 2021 --emit stdout \
  > backends/plonky3/tests/generated/fibonacci_ensemble.rs
```

Run the generated witness and end-to-end proof tests:

```bash
cargo test --release --manifest-path backends/plonky3/Cargo.toml \
  --test fibonacci_ensemble_tests -- --nocapture
cargo test --release --manifest-path backends/plonky3/Cargo.toml \
  --test femtocairo_flat_air_tests -- --nocapture
```

The largest test generates, proves, and verifies a 4,096-step Fibonacci execution and reports
witness generation, proving, verification, trace dimensions, and serialized proof size.

The generated ensemble path accepts a separately serialized runtime prover input for initializing
private committed columns. Clean's semantic `ProverData` is not supplied by the caller: it is
derived from the final component rows. Extracted witness programs may read stable cells of
preallocated component data; reads from demand-generated or mutable cells are rejected during
extraction. External hint reads remain unsupported.
